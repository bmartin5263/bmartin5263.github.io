                        A text-based recreation of Mattel's card game written in C++ and built using my custom text-based game engine <a href="#cursen">Cursen</a>.
                        <span class="note">Uno features text-based graphics with fluent animations, non-blocking IO, and 4-player online multiplayer.</span>
                        I developed this game in parallel with its engine, which handles the event loop for the game and rendering the text graphics.
                        Check out it's project section to learn more about how Cursen handles those tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My process for developing this game was to first create a Lobby screen where players connect together, chat, and change their game color, and then work on the Match screen where the actual gameplay occurs.
                        I first got the simpler Lobby screen working with networking where the toughest challenge was connecting players to the host, then I moved on to the Match screen where the challenge was then orchestrating the various game state messages between players.
                        To handle multiple game modes while reusing core UI elements <span class="note">I used a Strategy Pattern by defining a <code>Controller</code> abstract base class in which different game mode subclasses could implement.</span>
                        These Controllers override various abstract methods that change the interface, controls, and game flow based on the game mode selected at the start.
                        I also used a State Pattern to block user input during event scenes and animations whereby changing the input state was as simple as changing a pointer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Implementing the multiplayer support was the greatest challenge in developing the game.
                        Synchronizing the game state with multiple computers over plain sockets required me to define protocols for my program in how communication would occur and what form the messages would take.
                        <span class="note">My strategy for connecting players together was to have one player act as the host player who holds the authoritative game state and all changes to the game state go through them.</span>
                        Other players would then connect to the host player's IP address from the game lobby.
                        The host player enforces the game's rules by validating that messages sent by other players are legal game actions and applying them to the game state.
                        <span class="note">Connecting players simply update their game states whenever the host sends a new one and render animations based on game events.</span>

                        I implemented my messaging system using a Command Pattern, where <span class="note">each possible message is defined as a subclass of an abstract <code>Command</code> base class and would fill in the details of what to do when executed and how to be serialized.</span>
                        Once the <code>Command</code> is serialized, additional header information is written that tells the receiver which command type it is as well as how many bytes the message is.
                        The receiver first checks how big the message is and continues reading until it consumed n-many bytes.
                        The receiver then checks the header of the message for a byte representing which class to deserialize the raw buffer to, then it deserializes the buffer and executes the command.
                        <span class="note">All changes to the game state get translated into messages that are forwarded to a command queue for serialization and distribution.</span>
                        Depending on the game mode and network role, some messages are looped back to the sender or not sent at all and just executed locally.

                        <span class="note">Prototype rules engine and embedded domain-specific language developed at CNA that can generate human-readable documentation from coded business rules.</span>
                        The project was born from a request from the business to explore ideas on how to automate our rules documentation, which at the time was a manually-maintained <span class="note">300+ row Excel spreadsheet.</span>
                        Our business rules change constantly but the spreadsheet would not always get updated, causing our documentation to drift further and further out of sync with the code and confusing our partners.
                        <span class="note">The way that Rosetta works is that developers write validation and transformation <code>Scripts</code> that define what are acceptable values for <code>Properties</code> incoming JSON requests as well as defaults if a value is missing.</span>
                        At runtime those <code>Scripts</code> get compiled and can be rendered into an Excel spreadsheet for documentation or be executed against real JSON requests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The engine is conceptually broken down into three modules, the frontend, intermediate, and backend modules.
                        The frontend is what scriptwriters interact with, it consists of the Kotlin classes that define the embedded DSL and how that DSL is transformed into an in-memory AST.
                        The backend is what users interact with at runtime, it consists of services that accept the AST as input, notably the <code>Documentor</code> and <code>Interpreter</code>.
                        The <code>Documentor</code> generates tabulated documentation with each row being a JSON property and its rules while the <code>Interpreter</code> executes the rules themselves to generate invalid and missing data messages.
                    </p>

                        <span class="note">A notable challenge in developing the frontend module was designing a DSL that could be expressive enough handle many validation scenarios while being intuitive enough so developers can pick it up easily.</span>
                        Many features would have been nice to include into the language, but it was often the case that their behavior was too subtle to be expressed fully in the language itself.
                        It was a constant tug-of-war which required repeated experimentation and feedback from peers to get right.
                        I ended up choosing Kotlin to create an embedded DSL using its DSL building features which made it possible to leverage our IDEs autocomplete features and type safety when writing rules.

                        <a href="images/lens-example.png" data-lightbox="lens-example"><img src="images/lens-example.png" style="float: right; width: 450px; padding-left: 10px" alt="Lens Example Usage Pseudocode"></a>
                        To give the <code>Scripts</code> the ability to interact with properties in the JSON payload, I developed a <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/lenses-b85976cb0534">Lens</a> library for Kotlin.
                        <span class="note">Lenses are a series of setters & getters that are used traverse the request POJO object tree while protecting against null pointer exceptions and generating a JSON path from class metadata, such as annotations.</span>
                        My lens library makes use of reflection and Kotlin's reified inline functions to automatically determine from a setter or getter what the underlying field is to generate an object path.
                        This allows the DSL writers to free themselves from the burden of crafting JSON paths or checking for null pointers, the lenses handle it automatically with the added benefit of retaining generic type information.
                        Properties themselves come in two flavors, <code>Solo</code> and <code>Poly</code> properties, where <code>Solos</code> always return 1 nullable item while <code>Polys</code> return 0 to many items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At runtime, the DSL is translated to an in-memory AST that represents the business logic.
                        <span class="note">I used a Visitor pattern to develop an Interpreter and Documentor which would traverse the tree structure to either execute the rules on a JSON request or produce documentation.</span>
                        The Interpreter would handle testing the request generating helpful error messages while the Documentor could output the logic as an Excel spreadsheet or JSON for web consumption.

                        Developed as a class project in a class of Software Architecture over a 10-week period as a pedagogical exercise in learning about software design patterns.
                        Students received a minimal game engine to kickstart their development that was able to draw a 2D sprite and play a sound, the rest of the game was up to us.

                        One of the concerns with building a real-time game when using a managed language like C# is the pauses caused by garbage collection and object allocation.
                        To mitigate this, <span class="note">Object Pools were utilized that were pre-allocated with game objects and would hold onto released objects in an internal <code>Linked List</code>.</span>
                        This helped prevent the garbage collector from trying to reclaim memory and led to a smoother gameplay experience.
                        This also made "allocating" a new object as simple as popping a node off the list of free objects.
                        I wrote an <code>ObjectPool</code> abstract base class that would manage the lists of free and allocated objects and subclasses would implement how specific objects are allocated.

                        To handle the alien grid efficiently, a combination of patterns were used.
                        A Composite Pattern was used to organize the aliens into a tiered hierarchy from an individual alien at the bottom, to a column of aliens, and then to the entire grid at the top.
                        <span class="note">By organizing the aliens in such a manner I reduced the amount of collision checks by first checking if an upper tier faced a collision before checking lower tiers.</span>
                        Double dispatch was used in a Visitor Pattern to handle checking for collisions between two game objects.

                        <span class="note">A text-based user interface <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface">(TUI)</a> framework developed for C++ that can be used to create games and applications with text-based graphics.</span>
                        The name Cursen comes from "curses engine" as this project was conceived as a game engine that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> library to render text graphics in the terminal.
                        My goal was to construct a solid user interface framework that provided all the common functionalities I needed for writing text games and then use it to create other text-based applications, such as <a href="#uno">Uno</a>.
                        I also wanted to try and build a medium-scale application where I can apply many of the concepts I learned about during my senior year, like software design patterns and networking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The observable layout of Cursen was inspired by WinForms, such as how Cursen's UI <code>Component</code> objects are arranged within <code>Form</code> objects.
                        Cursen maintains internally a <code>Form</code> stack, with each <code>Form</code> keeping track of things like timer events, callbacks, and which <code>Components</code> to draw.
                        Components register themselves to their parent Forms and whatever <code>Form</code> is top of the stack those Components will be drawn and become interactable.
                        This design makes it easy for users to write games and applications with multiple screens that transition from one to the next while maintaining the states of the previous screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="images/cursen-overview.png" data-lightbox="cursen-overview"><img src="images/cursen-overview.png" style="float: left; width: 870px; padding-bottom: 10px;" alt="Cursen Diagram"></a>
                        User interface elements as well as any object that wishes to receive events from Cursen inherit from a <code>Component</code> abstract base class or one of it's abstract subclasses, depending on the purpose.
                        <span class="note">The <code>Component</code> class handles globally common functionality event registration, the <code>VisualComponent</code> subclass adds in properties describing where on screen the object should be drawn.</span>
                        <code>VisualComponent</code> has two subclasses, <code>TextComponent</code> which defines a 2D <code>chtype</code> array for drawing text graphics onto the terminal and <code>AggregateComponent</code> which is used to group multiple <code>Components</code> together into a single entity.
                        Cursen provides a few common UI elements builtin such as <code>Labels</code>, <code>Boxes</code>, <code>Lines</code>, <code>Buttons</code>, and <code>CheckBoxes</code>.
                        If users don't want to have to manually draw their own element with text graphics they can use the builtin elements and group them together with an <code>AggregateComponent</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="note">An <code>EventManager</code> handles dispatching application events to registered <code>Components</code> that occur in Cursen's event loop.</span>
                        At runtime, events such as key presses and timer expirations are placed onto an <code>EventQueue</code> to be processed.
                        I used an Observer Pattern to handle how Components register themselves for callbacks, where events are observed by Components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately it's worth noting that the app is far from perfect, there are a lot of places that I wished I would've done better.
                        One thing I'd improve is limiting the communications between managers and avoid having few manager classes do too much.

                        A small AI framework written in Java that can be used to solve single-agent games using a variety of different search algorithms.

                        I restricted my use of STL, strings, templates, and other advanced features so that I can also further understand the C language, just with the addition of classes.

                        Manual memory management was tough when most of my prior experience was in managed languages like Java and this program needed to use a lot of strings.

                        A recreation of the classic game Tetris with text-based graphics written in Python 3.
                        Created during my Junior year at DePaul University, my goal with this project was to experiment with the curses module and threading to create a text-based real-time game that deals with user-input concurrently with computer input.

                        This project was my first attempt at making a real-time game, previously I've only worked on turn-based games like Chess and Uno.
                        In order to make my game real-time I needed a way of getting individual key presses without blocking the event loop and a way to update the screen continuously.
                        I ended up learning about the ncurses Python library which solved both of these problems and gave me a solid text graphics foundation.

                        I also experimented with Python's threading module in order to make the tetris piece automatically fall when the user waits long enough.

                        A recreation of Mattel's card game written in C++ using my custom text-based game engine with 4-player online multiplayer capabilities.
                        My goal with this project was to put my text-based game engine Cursen to the test by creating an actual game out of it.
                        I also wanted to build something with multiplayer support over sockets <em>and</em> local single-player against a computer AI

                        <br>
                        The toughest feature to implement for this project was the multiplayer support over sockets.
                        My strategy for distributing game state is to have <span class="strong">one player act as the host</span>  who holds the authoritative game state and other players connect to that host.
                        The <span class="strong">host player enforces the game's rules</span> by validating messages sent by other players.
                        Any legal change to the game state causes the host broadcasting updates to each player
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I implemented my messages using the Command Pattern, where each possible message is defined as a class that can be serialized and sent over a socket.

                        Text-based Flash Cards program for creating decks of flash cards for taking notes and quizing yourself. Written in C++

                        This project was my first major program I developed using C++ as an excercise in understanding the language. I restricted my use of STL, templates, and other advanced features so I can also further understand the C language, just with the addition of classes
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was also my largest text-based application at the time, with multiple screens, saved data, various visual components, etc. The problems I encountered in making this program inspired me to start building Cursen, a event-based framework for developing text applications. This framework aims to streamline the production of text applications using a format similar to other GUI frameworks like WinForms

                        Recreation of the classic Tetris game with text-based graphics. Created during my Junior year at DePaul University, my goals with this project was to experiment with the curses module and threading to create a text-based non turn-based game that deals with user-input concurrently with computer input. Written in Python 3.

                        <br>
                        This project was my first attempt at making a Real-time game, as opposed to turn based games like Chess and Uno. In order to do this, I needed a way of getting individual key presses and update the screen constantly. To accomplish this, I learned about the NCurses module which solved both of those problems. Now I was able to receive input from the user without needing them to keep pressing enter and the screen wouldn't have to reprint itself in the terminal every update.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I also experimented with Python's threading module in order to make the tetris piece automatically fall when the user waits long enough.

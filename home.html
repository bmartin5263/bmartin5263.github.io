                    My name is Brandon Martin. I am a recent graduate of DePaul University where I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I have four years of experience doing Software Development as a hobby and nearly two years of experience doing Software Development professionally. On top of my programming experience, I also am a hobbyist filmmaker with several years of cinematographic experience working on my own short films and small client projects.

                   From a very young age I've was drawn to creating visually appealing and finely detailed works of art to show to all my friends. It started out with my love of Legos and designing unique structures with my own stories around them, stories I eventually started capturing on video. Fascinated by the prospect of telling stories in the film-medium led me to enroll in the Chicago Academy for the Arts, where I gained a formal arts training in filmmaking along with my standard High School courses. It was here I developed my own artistic style and realized my passion for creating unique, sometimes pleasantly ridiculous, experiences for my audience.

                    While my passion of filmmaking hasn't gone away, I discovered a new outlet for my creative desires when I took my first Computer Science course at DePaul University. I immediately fell in love with the idea of using code to create unique experiences for my users. It started off with creating simple text games, but that passion has driven me to continually expand my knowledge and challenge myself in the Software Engineering field so I can continue to make cooler and cooler applications.

                    Today, I continue to develop software both professionally and during my free time. Right now I am working on Cursen, a C++ framework built on top of ncurses for the purpose of simplifying the creation of complex TUI applications, since I love making command line apps.

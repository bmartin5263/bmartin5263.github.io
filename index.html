                <p>
                    My name is Brandon Martin. I'm a Chicago-based Software Developer who loves the challenge and excitement of constructing flexible and reusable software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my programming journey back in 2015 when I took my first Computer Science course at DePaul University and instantly fell in love.
                    Before this time I was interested in filmmaking and the visual arts, even going to art school for a couple of years.
                    I've always been interested in technology and the thrill of creating something of my own, whether it's a film or program
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm working at CNA Insurance in Chicago, IL where I work with an Agile team building REST APIs for our small buisiness clients.
                    During my time at CNA I have invested significant time in designing reusable software abstractions that can be applied across projects.
                    I've also spent time optimizing our codebase through repeated benchmarking to speed up our quoting logic and unit test executing time

                <p>
                    My most recent CNA project was a 6-month project prototyping a solution to automatically document our business rules executed on client's quote requests.
                    I took the initiative of creating a proof-of-concept rules engine that used an embedded Kotlin DSL for users to write business rules.
                    This rule engine included various tools to help developers to write rules and, ultimately, output the logic as an Excel spreadsheet for our clients
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my off time I enjoy coding recreationally, building my own projects and reading tech books.
                    My last project was recreating Uno with 4-Player online multiplayer over sockets and text-based graphics rendered with my own TUI library

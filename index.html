                <p>
                    My name is Brandon Martin. I'm a Chicago-based Software Developer who loves the challenge and excitement of constructing flexible and reusable software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my programming journey back in 2015 when I took my first Computer Science course at DePaul University and instantly fell in love.
                    Before this time I was interested in filmmaking and the visual arts, even going to art school for a couple of years.
                    I've always been interested in technology and the thrill of creating something of my own, whether it's a film or program
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm working at CNA Insurance in Chicago, IL where I work with an Agile team building REST APIs for our small business clients.
                    During my time at CNA I have invested significant time in <span class="strong">designing reusable software abstractions</span> and <span class="strong">building tools to automate devops tasks.</span>
                    I've also optimized our codebase through repeated benchmarking to <span class="strong">speed up executing time</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    My most recent CNA project was a 6-month project prototyping a solution to <span class="strong">automatically document our business rules</span> executed on client's quote requests.
                    I took the initiative of creating a proof-of-concept rules engine that used an <span class="strong">embedded Kotlin DSL</span> for users to write business rules.
                    This rule engine included various tools to help developers to write rules and, ultimately, <span class="strong">output the logic as an Excel spreadsheet</span> for our clients
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my off-time I enjoy building my own software projects and reading computer books.
                    My last project was a recreation Uno with <span class="strong">4-Player online multiplayer over sockets</span> and text-based graphics rendered with my own TUI library

                    My name is Brandon Martin. I'm a Chicago-based Software Developer who loves the challenge and excitement of constructing flexible and reusable software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started my programming journey back in 2015 when I took my first Computer Science course at DePaul University and quickly fell in love.
                    Before this time I was interested in <a href="videos.html">filmmaking</a> and the visual arts, even going to art high school to sharpen my skills.
                    I found the joy of building a game or app analogous to the joy of shooting a movie, and programming gave me more freedom to be creative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working as an <span class="note">Application Developer at CNA Insurance building REST APIs in SpringBoot</span> for our small business clients.
                    Some of my contributions include introducing abstract base classes into our insurance quoting request/response class hierarchy allowing for increased code reuse across modules through polymorphism.
                    I've also <span class="note">sped up our quoting response time and test run time through repeated benchmarking</span> to find opportunities to introduce caching or asynchronous calls.
                    In addition to writing code, I've also invested significant time <span class="note">documenting and drawing diagrams for new and existing projects to help onboard new teammates.</span>
                </p>

                    A notable project I took the lead on was <a href="projects.html#rosetta">Rosetta</a>, a 6-month <span class="note">Java prototype rules engine and custom domain-specific language that allowed developers to write self-documenting business rules.</span>
                    I designed an embedded Kotlin DSL for other developers to write business rules using a fluent API that clearly expressed validation logic.
                    The rule engine parsed the DSL rules and could <span class="note">execute the rules on actual JSON requests or output the rules as an Excel spreadsheet for documentation.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work I enjoy building my own software projects and reading about software development.
                    One of my favorite projects I've built was a recreation of <span class="note"><a href="projects.html#uno">Uno</a> with 4-player online multiplayer over sockets built with my own text-based UI engine <a href="projects.html#cursen">Cursen</a>.</span>
                    Check out my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> section to learn more about some of the programs I've developed.
